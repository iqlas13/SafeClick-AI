/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict, privacy-first user-ownership model.
 * Each user has complete control over their own document and is completely isolated from all other users.
 * The default posture is to deny all access, granting permissions explicitly and narrowly.
 *
 * Data Structure: The data is organized into a single top-level collection `/users`, where the
 * document ID for each user's record is their Firebase Authentication UID. This creates a simple
 * and secure user-scoped data tree.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Enumeration is Forbidden: Listing the entire `/users` collection is explicitly disallowed
 *   to protect the privacy of all users on the platform.
 * - Strict Ownership: A user can only read, create, update, or delete their own user document.
 *   They cannot see or modify any other user's data.
 * - Self-Creation: A user can create their own user document, but only if the document ID
 *   matches their authentication UID.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: The data structure is inherently optimized for authorization.
 * By using the user's UID as the document ID (`/users/{userId}`), we establish ownership directly
 * through the document path. This eliminates the need for any slow or costly `get()` calls
 * to check permissions, resulting in fast and efficient security rules.
 *
 * Structural Segregation: This principle is not applicable here as the application currently
 * only deals with a single type of user-private data. If public data were introduced, it would be
 * placed in a separate top-level collection.
